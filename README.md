Improving search functionality of swedish police's incident reports page by using their API (https://polisen.se/api/events)
The original police site only lets you chose a location in Sweden even though the API has functionality for much more!

- [x] select location query
- [x] select time query
Todo:
- [ ] select one or more types of incidents
- [ ] finish tailwind styling
- [ ] store all in DB because polisen removes incidents from API after some time?
